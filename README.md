CDC research led to the estimate that over 300,000 people are likely diagnosed and treated each year in the United States. Additional research by CDC scientists is ongoing to determine the economic burden of Lyme disease. CDC research also indicates that the total cost of Lyme disease testing alone is estimated at $492 millionExternal.
